### Putting it together
1. Prepare the legs: put `leg-foot`s on one end of leg aluminium extrusions, and `leg-hinge-mount` on the other end. Secure them with the M4x8 bolts and t-nuts (just one bolt per part is necessary).
2. Put the M8 nuts in the nutcatches on the `stand-center`.
2. Put `stand-center` on the rail extrusion. Secure with a M4x8 bolt and a t-nut.
3. Place the prongs of the `leg-hinge-mount`s in the slots of the `stand-center`. Secure with the M8 bolt. Loosen to change the leg position.
4. If using a blast deflector, fasten the metal corner bracket to the launch rail.
